# PayRollSystem
This is java project to practice OOPs concept
This is a employee payroll System.
In this project we create a abstract employee class which contain abstract method calculatesalary() and we will override it as per our need for full time and part time employees.

Create full time employee class which will extend employee class. override the abtract method calculatesalary() which will return its monthly salary which is fixed.

create part time employee class.
Part time employee will work on hourly basis so the salary will be (hourWorked * per hour Rate).

now make a pay roll class which will add employees in list.
make different Methods like displayEmployees(), getName(), getSalary() of particular emp with ID. etc

Thats it.
